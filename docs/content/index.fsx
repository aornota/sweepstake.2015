## Sunday 27th September

### Game #19

**Group D: [Ireland](teams.html#Ireland) 44 - 10 [Romania](teams.html#Romania)**

Denis picks up the expected bonus point Irish win - but the big movers are Susie (two tries for Tommy Bowe) and Chad (a try for Chris Henry 
and the boot of Ian Madigan).

### Game #18

**Group B: [Scotland](teams.html#Scotland) 39 - 16 [United States](teams.html#United States)**

Get your protractors out! The reigning Five Nations champions earn a bonus point win over the reigning Olympic champions, which is good 
news for Hugh who also picks up a couple of points from the boot of Finn Russell. Susie likewise benefits from Greig Laidlaw's kicking - 
and Jack from a mixed kicking display from man-of-the-match Stuart Hogg.

### Injury update #3

Jean de Villiers (South Africa), Waisea Nayacalevu (Fiji) and Liam Underwood (Canada) have been withdrawn through injury and replaced by 
Jan Serfontein, Timoci Nagusa and James Pritchard respectively. No sweepstakers are affected.

Still awaiting news on various Welsh players (Scott Williams, Hallam Amos and Liam Williams), not to mention a possible citing for Tom 
Wood...

### Game #17

**Group A: [Australia](teams.html#Australia) 65 - 3 [Uruguay](teams.html#Uruguay)**

A bonus point Australian win for Chris is slightly soured by a yellow card - and two tries from man-of-the-match Sean McMahon allow Chad to 
leapfrog Chris at the bottom. Quade Cooper had a great game with ball in hand - but his rubbish kicking and indiscipline lead to a solitary 
point for Martyn. Jack powers on with a try from Matt 'Top-knot' Toomua; Jem snaps at his heels with a last-gap try from Tevita Kuridrani. 
Henry Speight scores a try to keep Hugh in third, closely followed by Neph thanks to a pair of tries from Ben McCalman.

## Saturday 26th September

### Game #16

**Group A: [England](teams.html#England) 25 - 28 [Wales](teams.html#Wales)**

Sixteen matches down, thirty-two to go - and the hosts are teetering on the brink...

Disappointment for England at somehow losing despite dominating the set-pieces and edging the aerial battle - and elation for a resilient 
Wales who finished the game playing two scrum-halves, two fly-halves and one centre. I still wouldn't want to predict which two teams will 
survive the Group of Death. (And barring a miracle recovery, I'll start thinking about my replacement for Scott Williams; Denis might want 
to do likewise given the way Liam Williams left the field.) Jack stretches his lead with an English losing bonus point and a try from Jonny 
May. Martyn gets motoring with a Welsh win and nerveless kicking from Owen Farrell - but even that impressive haul is topped by Hugh who 
rockets up to third thanks to equally solid kicking (not withstanding his itching-powder-everywhere preparation) and a deserved 
man-of-the-match performance from Dan Biggar.

### Game #15

**Group B: [South Africa](teams.html#South Africa) 46 - 6 [Samoa](teams.html#Samoa)**

The Springboks bounce back with a bonus point win for Rosie, who also gets a Bryan Habana try. Martyn picks up a solitary point via Pat 
Lambie. A try from Schalk Burger and some flaky kicking from man-of-the-match Handre Pollard sees Jack storm past the century mark, closely 
followed by Jem (who could have taken the lead if the great unwashed of Twitter had voted for Eben Etzebeth) thanks to three tries from JP 
Pietersen.

### Game #14

**Group D: [Italy](teams.html#Italy) 23 - 18 [Canada](teams.html#Canada)**

Hey buddy, Canada wants one of those losing bonus points, guy... Italy have probably done just about enough to qualify for the 2019 World 
Cup. No points for anyone.

## Friday 25th September

### Game #13

**Group C: [Argentina](teams.html#Argentina) 54 - 9 [Georgia](teams.html#Georgia)**

A very expensive yellow card for Georgia helps Argentina to a bonus point win that keeps Neph moving in the right direction. Jack extends 
his lead (despite the indiscipline of Mamuka Gorgodze) after another assured kicking display from Nicolas Sanchez (including the first drop 
goal of the tournament). Chris continues the long haul back to contention with a pair of tries from Juan Imhoff, leaving Chad propping up 
the table once more.

## Thursday 24th September

### Game #12

**Group C: [New Zealand](teams.html#New Zealand) 58 - 14 [Namibia](teams.html#Namibia)**

Not sure that Steve Hansen is going to be too happy with that ragged display from the All Blacks. Still, Susie gets the expected bonus 
point win. Hugh doubles his tally with a pair of tries (and another head-scratching man-of-the-match award) for Nehe Milner-Skudder. Chris 
nearly drags himself off the bottom with tries from Malakei Fekitoa and Ben Smith. But the big winner is Jem who moves up to joint-second 
with two tries from Julian Savea and one each for Victor Vito and Beauden Barrett (plus some erratic kicking from the latter).

## Wednesday 23rd September

### Game #11

**Group D: [France](teams.html#France) 38 - 11 [Romania](teams.html#Romania)**

A bonus point French win scores points for Jem. Denis is snapping at Jack's heels after a try (and a somewhat mystifying man-of-the-match 
award) for Wesley Fofana. (Brice Dulin would have got my vote. Sadly that's not how it works...) Morgan Parra does what Morgan Parra 
usually does, which translates to some welcome points for Rosie. And Susie continues to sneak towards the right end of the table with a try 
from Yannick Nyanga (who had a very good game).

### Game #10

**Group A: [Australia](teams.html#Australia) 28 - 13 [Fiji](teams.html#Fiji)**

No bonus point for Australia - but the win sees Chris creep back into positive territory. Jem slips back as a result of Tevita Kuridrani's 
yellow card; Campese Ma'afu's indiscipline likewise costs Chad. The big winner is Jack, who takes the lead thanks to two tries from 
man-of-the-match David Pocock; Neph stays in touch with some successful kicks from Nemani Nadolo; and Rosie benefits from Bernard Foley's 
assured kicking.

### Game #9

**Group B: [Scotland](teams.html#Scotland) 45 - 10 [Japan](teams.html#Japan)**

Japan come back down to earth after a devastating second-half spell from an impressive Scotland.

Big moves for Susie (via man-of-the-match Greig Laidlaw and his reliable kicking) and Hugh (via a bonus point Scottish win and a try from 
Finn Russell).

### Injury update #2

Andrea Masi (Italy) has been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Michele Visentin. No-one cares.

## Monday 21st September

### Injury update #1

Yoann Huget (France) and Cory Allen (Wales) have been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Remy Grosso and Tyler Morgan respectively.

Awaiting clarification from Chris as to who he wants to replace Yoann Huget...

## Sunday 20th September

### Game #8

**Group C: [New Zealand](teams.html#New Zealand) 26 - 16 [Argentina](teams.html#Argentina)**

Eight matches down, forty to go - and everything still to play for...

A New Zealand win and man-of-the-match Brodie Retallick help Susie pull away from the bottom two, whilst Chad likewise keeps moving in the 
right direction with tries from Sam Cane and Aaron Smith. Solid kicking from the impressive Nicolas Sanchez allows Jack to make up ground 
on Denis. Neph edges back in front, albeit with Dan Carter's ever-reliable kicking offset by Argentine (Pablo Matera) and Kiwi (Conrad 
Smith, of all people) indiscipline. And a yellow card for Richie McCaw leaves Chris hoping for better things when we resume on Wednesday.

### Game #7

**Group A: [Wales](teams.html#Wales) 54 - 9 [Uruguay](teams.html#Uruguay)**

Probably not quite the points difference Wales were hoping for - and more injury concerns to boot (though Matthew Morgan looks like a 
decent player).

Martyn continues creeping up the table thanks to a bonus point Welsh win; Jack consolidates third place with a try from Justin Tipuric 
(when he remembered not to drop the ball); and Denis retakes the lead via the reliable kicking of Rhys Priestland.

(Man-of-the-match was eventually announced as Cory Allen, so no points for anyone on that front.)

### Game #6

**Group B: [Samoa](teams.html#Samoa) 25 - 16 [United States](teams.html#United States)**

Nice and easy, this one: no points for anyone!

I suspect that the next match will be a different story...

## Saturday 19th September

### Game #5

**Group D: [France](teams.html#France) 32 - 10 [Italy](teams.html#Ireland)**

Damn, I really though Guilhem Guirado was going to confirm my lucky bastard status by scoring there. Ah well, musn't grumble.

Anyway, Jem races up the table thanks to the French team - and to Frederick Michalak and Louis Picamoles in particular. Nicolas Mas scores 
a try for Rosie; Scott Spedding gives Susie a small boost.

Tomorrow will see Samoa, United States, Wales, Uruguay, New Zealand and Argentina play their first matches; Scotland, Australia and Romania 
have to wait until Wednesday; Namibia start their campaign against the All Blacks on Thursday (lucky them)...

### Game #4

**Group B: [South Africa](teams.html#South Africa) 32 - 34 [Japan](teams.html#Japan)**

Wow! A stunning performance from Japan in one of the best games I've even seen. (Shane Williams wasn't wrong when he said that Japan would 
play for the full eighty minutes.)

Mixed results for Rosie: tries from Bismarck du Plessis and Adriaan Strauss - but nil points for South Africa (their two bonus points being 
offset by Coenie Oosthuizen's yellow card). Francois Louw and Michael Leitch do the business for Neph; Pat Lambie and Handre Pollard keep 
things ticking over for Martyn and Jack.

### Game #3

**Group D: [Ireland](teams.html#Ireland) 50 - 7 [Canada](teams.html#Canada)**

A solid Irish performance sees Denis retake the lead with a bonus point win (slightly marred by Paul O'Connell's yellow card) and tries 
from Sean O'Brien and Iain Henderson. Jonathan Sexton takes Neph up to second; Ian Madigan moves Chad into positive territory.</p>
 
### Game #2

**Group C: [Tonga](teams.html#Tonga) 10 - 17 [Georgia](teams.html#Georgia)**

A typically barnstorming performance from Mamuka Gorgodze sees Jack take the lead - though Denis will be expecting a bucketload of points 
from the next game.

## Friday 18th September

### Game #1

**Group A: [England](teams.html#England) 35 - 11 [Fiji](teams.html#Fiji)**

Denis races out to an early lead thanks to a deserved man-of-the-match performance from Mike Brown in, frankly, a pretty scrappy game. Jack 
gets a bonus point English win and a penalty try to boot. Hugh scores via the slimmed-down Billy Vunipola; Neph via man-mountain Nemani 
Nadolo (or "Nandolo", as Nick Mullins insists on calling him; maybe he's thinking of Nando's?). Martyn and Susie pick up points from the 
boots of Owen Farrell and George Ford respectively. And a yellow card for Nikola Matawalu (who almost redeemed himself with what would have 
been a brilliant try) leave Chad stuck in reverse gear.

#### A brief note on replacements

Once the tournament is underway, if one of your players is withdrawn, I'll try and let you know (or you can let me know). You can then pick 
any unpicked player as a replacement - with the proviso that you will only be credited with points that they score from that point onwards. 
(If there's a sudden spate of withdrawals, replacements will be allocated on a first-come first-served basis.)

#### Payout structure

The payout structure will be: fifty quid for first place; thirty quid for second place; and twenty quid for third place. (Sorry, 
<strike>Denis</strike> <strike>Chad</strike> Chris, no wooden spoon prize this time.)
