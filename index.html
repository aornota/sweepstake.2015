<h4>Upcoming fixtures</h4>

<p>Saturday 31st October at 16:00 -- Final: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a><em></em> vs <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a></p>

<h2>Friday 30th October</h2>

<h3>Game #47</h3>

<p><strong>Bronze final: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 24 - 13 <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a></strong></p>

<p>Rosie picked Julian Montoya (Argentina) as her replacement for Marcos Ayerza before kick-off.</p>

<p>A game too far for a much-changed Argentina sees South Africa finish third. Jack needlessly extends his lead thanks to the reliable boot 
of the wonderful Nicolas Sanchez and the slightly flakier kicking of Handre Pollard. (Let's not mention the worst kick for touch in 
recent memory.) Neph drops a couple of points as a result of Tomas Cubelli's early yellow card. Jem closes the gap to second with tries 
from JP Pietersen and Eben Etzebeth. Rosie picks up the South African win and still has faint hopes of a top-three finish. Chad scores 
via man-of-the-match (and star of the future) Damian de Allende.</p>

<p>Unless I hear from Martyn before kick-off tomorrow, I'll give him Sekope Kepu (Australia) as his replacement for Wyatt Crockett.</p>

<h3>Injury update #12</h3>

<p>Marcos Ayerza (Argentina) and Wyatt Crockett (New Zealand) have been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Santiago Garcia Botta and 
Pauliasi Manu respectively.</p>

<p>(Note that although Santiago Garcia Botta was called up less than 48 hours before the Bronze final kick-off, he will be allowed to play 
"if absolutely required" because Lucas Noguera Paz will cover hooker from the bench, leaving Argentina with too few fit props.)</p>

<p>Awaiting clarification from Rosie and Martyn as to their replacements for Marcos Ayerza and Wyatt Crockett respectively. (Given that 
Martyn is apparently building houses in Nepal, I'll unilaterally pick a replacement if I haven't heard from him before the final.)</p>

<h2>Sunday 25th October</h2>

<h3>Game #46</h3>

<p><strong>Semi-final 2: <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a> 15 - 29 <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a></strong></p>

<p>A shaky start leaves Argentina too much to do as Australia's experience and composure take them into the final. Jack benefits from the 
boot of Nicolas Sanchez, though Neph trims his lead a little with three tries and a man-of-the-match performance from Adam Ashley-Cooper 
(offset by a yellow card for Tomas Lavanini). Rosie picks up a few points after a mixed kicking display from Bernard Foley. Chris moves 
up to eighth with the Australia bonus point win.</p>

<h2>Saturday 24th October</h2>

<h3>Game #45</h3>

<p><strong>Semi-final 1: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 18 - 20 <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a></strong></p>

<p>After the excitement of the quarter-finals, a tense and scrappy game sees the All Blacks through to the final. Jack extends his lead 
with another fine kicking display from Handre Pollard. Jem gets a try from the brilliant Beauden Barrett but Neph hangs on to second 
thanks to the dependable boot of Dan Carter. Rosie slips back despite the South African bonus point in defeat as a yellow card for Bryan 
Habana proves doubly costly. Susie gets the New Zealand win, offset by a yellow card for Jerome Kaino - which also costs Martyn, though 
he does get a try from the same player plus a solitary Pat Lambie kick. Chris scores for a man-of-the-match performance from Ben Smith.</p>

<h2>Sunday 18th October</h2>

<h3>Game #44</h3>

<p><strong>Quarter-final 4: <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a> 35 - 34 <a href="teams.html#Scotland">Scotland</a></strong></p>

<p>Was that the Scottish dressing room at half-time - or a homeless shelter in Govan?</p>

<p>Four-nil. A brilliant quarter-final weekend comes to a nerve-shredding (and somewhat contentious) end as an intelligent and committed 
Scottish display ends in disappointment, leaving Australia shaken but somehow unbeaten - and ensuring that the Webb Ellis Cup remains in 
the southern hemisphere. As you were in the table, albeit with Jack's lead trimmed and Martyn further adrift at the bottom. Chris gets 
the bonus point Australian win, plus a man-of-the-match performance from Matt Giteau. Hugh picks up a Scottish bonus point in defeat, 
sullied by a marginal yellow card for Sean Maitland. Susie scores via the dependable boot of Greig Laidlaw - and Rosie via the less 
dependable kicking of Bernard Foley. Neph, Jem and Chad get tries from Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani and Michael Hooper 
respectively.</p>

<p>The semi-finals have a lot to live up to...</p>

<h3>Game #43</h3>

<p><strong>Quarter-final 3: <a href="teams.html#Ireland">Ireland</a> 20 - 43 <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a></strong></p>

<p>Almost an incredible comeback from Ireland - but a deserved Argentine victory makes it three-nil and leaves the hopes of the northern 
hemisphere in the hands of Scotland (who have recorded two extremely dull wins over Australia in their last three meetings). Jack 
stretches his lead with a near-flawless kicking display from Nicolas Sanchez, who also gets a rather questionable man-of-the-match 
award. (To be fair, he was very good; I just think that Pablo Matera and Joaquin Tuculet were even better.) Chris picks up two tries 
from Juan Imhoff, leaving Martyn in last place once again. Denis gets a try from Luke Fitzgerald - but with only four players left, 
he's still in contention for the wooden spoon. The bonus point Argentine win (offset by a yellow card for Ramiro Herrera) takes Neph up 
to second. Chad trundles on with a few points via the boot of Ian Madigan.</p>

<h2>Saturday 17th October</h2>

<h3>Game #42</h3>

<p><strong>Quarter-final 2: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a> 62 - 13 <a href="teams.html#France">France</a></strong></p>

<p>"I don't see a punch; I just see a fist in the face." They could do with the calm semantics of Nigel Owens' refereeing at kicking-out 
time in Port Talbot tonight...</p>

<p>Emphatically two-nil - and points for everyone other than Jack, Chad and Chris as the All Blacks turn on the style against a poor French 
side. Jem leaps up to second thanks to three tries from man-of-the-match Julian Savea and one from Louis Picamoles (although the 
latter's indiscipline costs him twice). Susie is up to sixth with the bonus point New Zealand win, a try from Brodie Retallick and 
another monster kick from Scott Spedding. Hugh and Neph are tied for third after a try from Nehe Milner-Skudder for the former and a
solid kicking display from Dan Carter for the latter. Rosie picks up a meagre haul via the boot of Morgan Parra. Denis makes up ground 
on Chad with a try from Kieran Read. And Martyn finally moves off the bottom with a try from Jerome Kaino, leaving Chris staring at the 
prestigious wooden spoon.</p>

<h3>Game #41</h3>

<p><strong>Quarter-final 1: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 23 - 19 <a href="teams.html#Wales">Wales</a></strong></p>

<p>One-nil to the southern hemisphere after a brilliant bit of improvisation from Duane Vermeulen and Fourie de Preez. Jack stretches his 
lead with a mixed kicking display from Handre Pollard and a thoroughly deserved man-of-the-match performance from Schalk Burger. Hugh 
moves up to second thanks to the boot of Dan Biggar (though he might be concerned about how rapidly he's haemorrhaging players). Rosie 
remains in fourth despite the South African win - and a Welsh bonus point in defeat is not enough to drag Martyn off the bottom.</p>

<h3>Injury update #11</h3>

<p>Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro (Argentina) has been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Juan Figallo.</p>

<p>The replacement for Jared Payne (Ireland) has been confirmed as Isaac Boss.</p>

<h2>Tuesday 13th October</h2>

<h3>Injury update #10</h3>

<p>Jack has picked Rabah Slimani (France) as his replacement for Peter O'Mahony.</p>

<h3>Injury update #9</h3>

<p>Paul O'Connell and Peter O'Mahony (both Ireland) have been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Mike McCarthy and Rhys Ruddock.</p>

<p>The replacement for Liam Williams (Wales) has been confirmed as Eli Walker (who was himself previously withdrawn from the squad because 
of injury!).</p>

<p>Denis has picked Rob Kearney (Ireland) and Lood de Jager (South Africa) as his replacements for Liam Williams and Paul O'Connell 
respectively.</p>

<p>Awaiting clarification from Jack as to his replacement for Peter O'Mahony.</p>

<h2>Sunday 11th October</h2>

<h3>Game #40</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#United States">United States</a> 18 - 28 <a href="teams.html#Japan">Japan</a></strong></p>

<p>Forty matches down and just eight to go... Jack has a healthy lead at the top, with Neph, Hugh, Rosie and Jem seemingly fighting it out 
for the other places on the podium. And the battle to avoid the wooden spoon appears to be between Martyn and Chris.</p>

<p>Japan and the United States round off the group stages with another enjoyable match. No points for any sweepstakers though.</p>

<h3>Game #39</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#France">France</a> 9 - 24 <a href="teams.html#Ireland">Ireland</a></strong></p>

<p>An attritional victory for Ireland sees them avoid the All Blacks in the quarter-finals - though at what cost (see injury update below)? 
Denis powers away from the bottom two thanks to the Irish win and a man-of-the-match performance from Sean O'Brien. Dodgy kicking from 
Frederic Michalak puts Jem in reverse. Neph picks up a few points from the boot of Jonathan Sexton; Susie and Rosie likewise from Scott 
Spedding and Morgan Parra respectively. Chad hauls himself up to sixth with a try from Conor Murray and a decent kicking display from Ian 
Madigan.</p>

<h3>Injury update #8</h3>

<p>Tony Woodcock (New Zealand) has been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Joe Moody. Martyn has picked Dean Mumm (Australia) as his 
replacement</p>

<p>Liam Williams (Wales) and Jared Payne (Ireland) have also been withdrawn; their replacements will be announced next week. Awaiting 
clarification from Denis as to his replacement for Liam Williams.</p>

<p>And Paul O'Connell, Peter O'Mahony and Jonathan Sexton (all Ireland) looked pretty dodgy leaving the pitch against France, so more news on 
them in due course...</p>

<h3>Game #38</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#Italy">Italy</a> 32 - 22 <a href="teams.html#Romania">Romania</a></strong></p>

<p>Farewell Italy and Romania. No points for anyone here.</p>

<h3>Game #37</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a> 64 - 19 <a href="teams.html#Namibia">Namibia</a></strong></p>

<p>A wonderful end to a very entertaining game as prop forward Johnny Redelinghuys - the first player to earn fifty caps for Namibia - ends 
his international career with a piss-poor attempt at a conversion. Neph gets his bonus point Argentine win (slightly soured by a yellow 
card for Marcelo Bosch that could easily have been a red), which leaves him tied for second after Hugh picks up a try from Leonardo 
Senatore. Susie scores via a try from Juan Martin Hernandez.</p>

<h2>Saturday 10th October</h2>

<h3>Game #36</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#England">England</a> 60 - 3 <a href="teams.html#Uruguay">Uruguay</a></strong></p>

<p>Pretty turgid stuff for the most part - but Jack will be happy that England finish the tournament as they started with both a bonus point 
win and a penalty try. Rosie moves up to second thanks to a try from Henry Slade. Hugh continues his charge towards the top three with a 
pair of tries from Anthony Watson. Flaky kicking from George Ford sees Susie take a small step backwards - but slightly better kicking from 
Owen Farrell leaves Martyn marginally better off than he started the day.</p>

<h3>Game #35</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a> 15 - 6 <a href="teams.html#Wales">Wales</a></strong></p>

<p>Brilliant defence from an Australian team with two men in the bin earns them a quarter-final against Scotland. Unfortunately for Chris, the 
Australian win is offset by yellow cards for Will Genia (also costly for Martyn) and Dean Mumm, plus a missed kick from Matt Giteau. Alex 
Cuthbert's idiotic yellow card hurts both Chad and Martyn's Welsh team. Hugh increases the gap between the top and bottom halves of the 
table despite Dan Biggar finally missing a kick. Rosie sneaks into third as Bernard Foley continues to impress.</p>

<h3>Game #34</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#Samoa">Samoa</a> 33 - 36 <a href="teams.html#Scotland">Scotland</a></strong></p>

<p>Scotland sneak into the quarter-finals after a fine game. Can they now go all the way? It seems unlikely... The Scottish win (offset by a 
yellow card for Ryan Wilson) keeps Hugh moving in the right direction though, whilst a try and the boot of Greig Laidlaw pull Susie towards 
the middle of the pack.</p>

<h2>Friday 9th October</h2>

<h3>Game #33</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a> 47 - 9 <a href="teams.html#Tonga">Tonga</a></strong></p>

<p>Points for everyone other than Jem, Rosie and Denis (unless you count minus points). Susie gets the bonus point New Zealand win - offset by 
a yellow card for Kieran Read, which also costs Denis. At the top, Jack maintains his lead with a try from Sonny Bill Williams and Neph 
moves up to second with a try from Ma'a Nonu (on his 100th appearance, a feat only matched by Brian O'Driscoll, Sergio Parisse and Adam 
Ashley-Cooper) and an improved kicking display from Dan Carter. At the bottom, Martyn picks up a try from Tony Woodcock and Chris gets a 
try from Ben Smith. In the middle, Chad gets a Sam Cane try - but the big winner is Hugh with two tries from man-of-the-match Nehe 
Milner-Skudder.</p>

<h2>Wednesday 7th October</h2>

<h3>Game #32</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#Namibia">Namibia</a> 16 - 17 <a href="teams.html#Georgia">Georgia</a></strong></p>

<p>Thirty-two matches down, sixteen to go - and Jack continues to set the pace, with Jem, Neph and Rosie fighting for a place on the podium. 
Plenty of time for fortunes to be made and lost, of course...</p>

<p>And after the longest and lowest-scoring first half in Rugby World Cup history, a compelling game finally finishes with the narrowest of 
victories for Georgia - and a bonus point for Namibia (but will they have anything left in the tank when they face Argentina in just over 
three-and-a-half days?). Jack stretches his lead with a farewell try from the ever-impressive Mamuka Gorgodze.</p>

<h3>Game #31</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 64 - 0 <a href="teams.html#United States">United States</a></strong></p>

<p>If Willem Alberts is "one hundred and twenty kilograms" of muscle, how much does he weigh in total?</p>

<p>Anyway, lots for the diligent updater to deal with after a brutal whitewash for the United States. Rosie rockets up to fourth with a bonus 
point South African win, a penalty try, three tries for Bryan Habana, one for Bismarck du Plessis and a few kicks from Morne Steyn. Neph 
hangs on to third with a pair of tries from Francois Louw. Chad continues his renaissance with a try from man-of-the-match Damian de 
Allende. Martyn remains bottom despite tries from Jesse Kriel and Lwazi Mvovo. And Jack stretches his lead thanks to the boot of Handre 
Pollard.</p>

<h2>Tuesday 6th October</h2>

<h3>Game #30</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#Fiji">Fiji</a> 47 - 15 <a href="teams.html#Uruguay">Uruguay</a></strong></p>

<p>Well that was a feisty game. Consolation for Uruguay in the form of two tries - but their defeat means that England have qualified for the 
2019 World Cup ;) ... Fiji's last hurrah proves fruitful for Chad with a bonus point win, two penalty tries and a try from man-of-the-match 
Leone Nakarawa (offset by a slightly harsh yellow card for Campese Ma'afu who did little more than fend off a psychotic scrum-half). Neph 
similarly benefits from Nemani Nadolo's last game of the tournament, a try and a decent kicking display consolidating his grip on third 
place (no doubt temporarily).</p>

<h3>Game #29</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#Canada">Canada</a> 15 - 17 <a href="teams.html#Romania">Romania</a></strong></p>

<p>An unwanted record for Canada as they fall victim to the greatest comeback in Rugby World Cup history. No points for any sweepstakers.</p>

<h3>Injury update #7</h3>

<p>Martin Castrogiovanni and Michele Rizzo (both Italy) have been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Alberto De Marchi and Andrea 
Lovotti.</p>

<h2>Sunday 4th October</h2>

<h3>Game #28</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#Ireland">Ireland</a> 16 - 9 <a href="teams.html#Italy">Italy</a></strong></p>

<p>A pretty dire game sees Denis get the Irish win - offset by Peter O'Mahony's yellow card, which also costs Jack - plus points for 
man-of-the-match Iain Henderson. Neph sneaks up to third with a few points from Jonathan Sexton.</p>

<h3>Game #27</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a> 45 - 16 <a href="teams.html#Tonga">Tonga</a></strong></p>

<p>Jack extends his lead after a very impressive man-of-the-match performance by Nicolas Sanchez in an entertaining game. Neph gets the bonus 
point Argentine win and a try from Santiago Cordero; Chris gets a try from Juan Imhoff.</p>

<h2>Saturday 3rd October</h2>

<h3>Game #26</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#England">England</a> 13 - 33 <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a></strong></p>

<p>The host nation fail to survive the Group of Death after a comprehensive defeat to an impressive Australia. Rosie rockets up for fourth 
thanks to two tries and consummate kicking from Bernard Foley (who some might think was more deserving of the man-of-the-match award than, 
uh, Joe Launchbury). Chris pulls away from the bottom with an Australian win and a try from Matt Giteau; Hugh picks up a try from Anthony 
Watson; Martyn gets a handful of points from Owen Farrell's kicking - offset by his yellow card, which also costs Jack's English team a 
couple of points.</p>

<h3>Game #25</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 34 - 16 <a href="teams.html#Scotland">Scotland</a></strong></p>

<p>Jack retakes the lead with a try from Schalk Burger and the reliable boot of Handre Pollard. Rosie gets the South African win (offset by a 
yellow card for Jannie du Plessis) and a try from Bryan Habana. Jem gets a try from JP Pietersen. Susie picks up a few points from Greig 
Laidlaw's kicking - offset by his yellow card, which also costs Hugh's Scottish team a couple of points.</p>

<h3>Game #24</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#Samoa">Samoa</a> 5 - 26 <a href="teams.html#Japan">Japan</a></strong></p>

<p>No points for anyone - though I think Filo Paulo deserves recognition for earning his yellow card with a dive right out of the Harry 
Kewell playbook.</p>

<h2>Friday 2nd October</h2>

<h3>Game #23</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a> 43 - 10 <a href="teams.html#Georgia">Georgia</a></strong></p>

<p>Three tries from Julian Savea see Jem take the lead. The other big scorer is Chris who moves off the bottom following tries from Waisake 
Naholo, Dane Coles and Malakai Fekitoa. Jack picks up points after another man-of-the-match performance from Mamuka Gorgodze. Susie gets 
the bonus point New Zealand win; Denis gets a try from Kieran Read; and Neph gets a fairly miserable haul after Dan Carter misses a few 
tricky conversions.</p>

<h2>Thursday 1st October</h2>

<h3>Game #22</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#France">France</a> 41 - 18 <a href="teams.html#Canada">Canada</a></strong></p>

<p>A good result for Jem who moves back into second after a bonus point French win and flawless kicking from man-of-the-match Frederic 
Michalak. Denis and Neph pick up points via tries from Wesley Fofana and Guilhem Guirado respectively; Rosie ekes out a couple of points 
from Morgan Parra.</p>

<h3>Game #21</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#Wales">Wales</a> 23 - 13 <a href="teams.html#Fiji">Fiji</a></strong></p>

<p>Martyn picks up points for the Welsh win and Hugh moves into second thanks to another assured kicking display from Dan Biggar.</p>

<h3>Injury update #6</h3>

<p>Davit Kubriashvili (Georgia) has been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Anton Peikrishvili.</p>

<p>Hugh has picked Pablo Matera (Argentina) as a replacement for Billy Vunipola; Martyn has picked Keven Mealamu (New Zealand) as a 
replacement for Wycliff Palu; Jem has picked Codie Taylor (New Zealand) as a replacement for Will Skelton.</p>

<p>And since we haven't heard from Chris, we're giving him Sofiane Guitoune (France) as a replacement for Yoann Huget until we hear otherwise.</p>

<h2>Tuesday 29th September</h2>

<h3>Injury update #5</h3>

<p>Will Skelton and Wycliff Palu (both Australia), Grant Gilchrist (Scotland), Connor Braid (Canada) and Ovidiu Tonita (Romania) have been 
withdrawn through injury and replaced by Sam Carter, James Hanson, Blair Cowan, Pat Parfrey and Vlad Nistor respectively.</p>

<p>This means that as well as the pending replacements for Chris (back) and Hugh (forward), Jem and Martyn both need to pick a forward... Neph 
has picked Santiago Cordero (Argentina) as a replacement for Scott Williams.</p>

<p>(I assume the Welsh will be happy not to be facing Nemani Nadolo on Thursday; I have mixed feelings...)</p>

<h3>Game #20</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#Tonga">Tonga</a> 35 - 21 <a href="teams.html#Namibia">Namibia</a></strong></p>

<p>Nothing to see here.</p>

<h2>Monday 28th September</h2>

<h3>Injury update #4</h3>

<p>Billy Vunipola (England), Scott Williams and Hallam Amos (both Wales) and Isei Colati (Fiji) have been withdrawn through injury and 
replaced by Nick Easter, Gareth Anscombe, James Hook and Taniela Koroi respectively. (Scotland's Grant Gilchrist also appears to be 
crocked; his withdrawal will be reflected once his replacement has been announced.)</p>

<p>Awaiting clarification from Hugh as to who he wants to replace Billy Vunipola - and I need to decide on a replacement for Scott Williams... 
And still waiting to hear from Chris about his replacement for Yoann Huget.</p>

<p>(Liam Williams remains in the Welsh squad, though won't be considered for the Fiji match. And common sense seems to have prevailed as far 
as the mooted citing of Tom Wood is concerned.)</p>

<h2>Sunday 27th September</h2>

<h3>Game #19</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#Ireland">Ireland</a> 44 - 10 <a href="teams.html#Romania">Romania</a></strong></p>

<p>Denis picks up the expected bonus point Irish win - but the big movers are Susie (two tries for Tommy Bowe) and Chad (a try for Chris Henry 
and the boot of Ian Madigan).</p>

<h3>Game #18</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#Scotland">Scotland</a> 39 - 16 <a href="teams.html#United States">United States</a></strong></p>

<p>Get your protractors out! The reigning Five Nations champions earn a bonus point win over the reigning Olympic champions, which is good 
news for Hugh who also picks up a couple of points from the boot of Finn Russell. Susie likewise benefits from Greig Laidlaw's kicking - 
and Jack from a mixed kicking display from man-of-the-match Stuart Hogg.</p>

<h3>Injury update #3</h3>

<p>Jean de Villiers (South Africa), Waisea Nayacalevu (Fiji) and Liam Underwood (Canada) have been withdrawn through injury and replaced by 
Jan Serfontein, Timoci Nagusa and James Pritchard respectively. No sweepstakers are affected.</p>

<p>Still awaiting news on various Welsh players (Scott Williams, Hallam Amos and Liam Williams), not to mention a possible citing for Tom 
Wood...</p>

<h3>Game #17</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a> 65 - 3 <a href="teams.html#Uruguay">Uruguay</a></strong></p>

<p>A bonus point Australian win for Chris is slightly soured by a yellow card - and two tries from man-of-the-match Sean McMahon allow Chad to 
leapfrog Chris at the bottom. Quade Cooper had a great game with ball in hand - but his rubbish kicking and indiscipline lead to a solitary 
point for Martyn. Jack powers on with a try from Matt 'Top-knot' Toomua; Jem snaps at his heels with a last-gap try from Tevita Kuridrani. 
Henry Speight scores a try to keep Hugh in third, closely followed by Neph thanks to a pair of tries from Ben McCalman.</p>

<h2>Saturday 26th September</h2>

<h3>Game #16</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#England">England</a> 25 - 28 <a href="teams.html#Wales">Wales</a></strong></p>

<p>Sixteen matches down, thirty-two to go - and the hosts are teetering on the brink...</p>

<p>Disappointment for England at somehow losing despite dominating the set-pieces and edging the aerial battle - and elation for a resilient 
Wales who finished the game playing two scrum-halves, two fly-halves and one centre. I still wouldn't want to predict which two teams will 
survive the Group of Death. (And barring a miracle recovery, I'll start thinking about my replacement for Scott Williams; Denis might want 
to do likewise given the way Liam Williams left the field.) Jack stretches his lead with an English losing bonus point and a try from Jonny 
May. Martyn gets motoring with a Welsh win and nerveless kicking from Owen Farrell - but even that impressive haul is topped by Hugh who 
rockets up to third thanks to equally solid kicking (not withstanding his itching-powder-everywhere preparation) and a deserved 
man-of-the-match performance from Dan Biggar.</p>

<h3>Game #15</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 46 - 6 <a href="teams.html#Samoa">Samoa</a></strong></p>

<p>The Springboks bounce back with a bonus point win for Rosie, who also gets a Bryan Habana try. Martyn picks up a solitary point via Pat 
Lambie. A try from Schalk Burger and some flaky kicking from man-of-the-match Handre Pollard sees Jack storm past the century mark, closely 
followed by Jem (who could have taken the lead if the great unwashed of Twitter had voted for Eben Etzebeth) thanks to three tries from JP 
Pietersen.</p>

<h3>Game #14</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#Italy">Italy</a> 23 - 18 <a href="teams.html#Canada">Canada</a></strong></p>

<p>Hey buddy, Canada wants one of those losing bonus points, guy... Italy have probably done just about enough to qualify for the 2019 World 
Cup. No points for anyone.</p>

<h2>Friday 25th September</h2>

<h3>Game #13</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a> 54 - 9 <a href="teams.html#Georgia">Georgia</a></strong></p>

<p>A very expensive yellow card for Georgia helps Argentina to a bonus point win that keeps Neph moving in the right direction. Jack extends 
his lead (despite the indiscipline of Mamuka Gorgodze) after another assured kicking display from Nicolas Sanchez (including the first drop 
goal of the tournament). Chris continues the long haul back to contention with a pair of tries from Juan Imhoff, leaving Chad propping up 
the table once more.</p>

<h2>Thursday 24th September</h2>

<h3>Game #12</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a> 58 - 14 <a href="teams.html#Namibia">Namibia</a></strong></p>

<p>Not sure that Steve Hansen is going to be too happy with that ragged display from the All Blacks. Still, Susie gets the expected bonus 
point win. Hugh doubles his tally with a pair of tries (and another head-scratching man-of-the-match award) for Nehe Milner-Skudder. Chris 
nearly drags himself off the bottom with tries from Malakei Fekitoa and Ben Smith. But the big winner is Jem who moves up to joint-second 
with two tries from Julian Savea and one each for Victor Vito and Beauden Barrett (plus some erratic kicking from the latter).</p>

<h2>Wednesday 23rd September</h2>

<h3>Game #11</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#France">France</a> 38 - 11 <a href="teams.html#Romania">Romania</a></strong></p>

<p>A bonus point French win scores points for Jem. Denis is snapping at Jack's heels after a try (and a somewhat mystifying man-of-the-match 
award) for Wesley Fofana. (Brice Dulin would have got my vote. Sadly that's not how it works...) Morgan Parra does what Morgan Parra 
usually does, which translates to some welcome points for Rosie. And Susie continues to sneak towards the right end of the table with a try 
from Yannick Nyanga (who had a very good game).</p>

<h3>Game #10</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#Australia">Australia</a> 28 - 13 <a href="teams.html#Fiji">Fiji</a></strong></p>

<p>No bonus point for Australia - but the win sees Chris creep back into positive territory. Jem slips back as a result of Tevita Kuridrani's 
yellow card; Campese Ma'afu's indiscipline likewise costs Chad. The big winner is Jack, who takes the lead thanks to two tries from 
man-of-the-match David Pocock; Neph stays in touch with some successful kicks from Nemani Nadolo; and Rosie benefits from Bernard Foley's 
assured kicking.</p>

<h3>Game #9</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#Scotland">Scotland</a> 45 - 10 <a href="teams.html#Japan">Japan</a></strong></p>

<p>Japan come back down to earth after a devastating second-half spell from an impressive Scotland.</p>

<p>Big moves for Susie (via man-of-the-match Greig Laidlaw and his reliable kicking) and Hugh (via a bonus point Scottish win and a try from 
Finn Russell).</p>

<h3>Injury update #2</h3>

<p>Andrea Masi (Italy) has been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Michele Visentin. No-one cares.</p>

<h2>Monday 21st September</h2>

<h3>Injury update #1</h3>

<p>Yoann Huget (France) and Cory Allen (Wales) have been withdrawn through injury and replaced by Remy Grosso and Tyler Morgan respectively.</p>

<p>Awaiting clarification from Chris as to who he wants to replace Yoann Huget...</p>

<h2>Sunday 20th September</h2>

<h3>Game #8</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#New Zealand">New Zealand</a> 26 - 16 <a href="teams.html#Argentina">Argentina</a></strong></p>

<p>Eight matches down, forty to go - and everything still to play for...</p>

<p>A New Zealand win and man-of-the-match Brodie Retallick help Susie pull away from the bottom two, whilst Chad likewise keeps moving in the 
right direction with tries from Sam Cane and Aaron Smith. Solid kicking from the impressive Nicolas Sanchez allows Jack to make up ground 
on Denis. Neph edges back in front, albeit with Dan Carter's ever-reliable kicking offset by Argentine (Pablo Matera) and Kiwi (Conrad 
Smith, of all people) indiscipline. And a yellow card for Richie McCaw leaves Chris hoping for better things when we resume on Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Game #7</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#Wales">Wales</a> 54 - 9 <a href="teams.html#Uruguay">Uruguay</a></strong></p>

<p>Probably not quite the points difference Wales were hoping for - and more injury concerns to boot (though Matthew Morgan looks like a 
decent player).</p>

<p>Martyn continues creeping up the table thanks to a bonus point Welsh win; Jack consolidates third place with a try from Justin Tipuric 
(when he remembered not to drop the ball); and Denis retakes the lead via the reliable kicking of Rhys Priestland.</p>

<p>(Man-of-the-match was eventually announced as Cory Allen, so no points for anyone on that front.)</p>

<h3>Game #6</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#Samoa">Samoa</a> 25 - 16 <a href="teams.html#United States">United States</a></strong></p>

<p>Nice and easy, this one: no points for anyone!</p>

<p>I suspect that the next match will be a different story...</p>

<h2>Saturday 19th September</h2>

<h3>Game #5</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#France">France</a> 32 - 10 <a href="teams.html#Ireland">Italy</a></strong></p>

<p>Damn, I really though Guilhem Guirado was going to confirm my lucky bastard status by scoring there. Ah well, musn't grumble.</p>

<p>Anyway, Jem races up the table thanks to the French team - and to Frederick Michalak and Louis Picamoles in particular. Nicolas Mas scores 
a try for Rosie; Scott Spedding gives Susie a small boost.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will see Samoa, United States, Wales, Uruguay, New Zealand and Argentina play their first matches; Scotland, Australia and Romania 
have to wait until Wednesday; Namibia start their campaign against the All Blacks on Thursday (lucky them)...</p>

<h3>Game #4</h3>

<p><strong>Group B: <a href="teams.html#South Africa">South Africa</a> 32 - 34 <a href="teams.html#Japan">Japan</a></strong></p>

<p>Wow! A stunning performance from Japan in one of the best games I've even seen. (Shane Williams wasn't wrong when he said that Japan would 
play for the full eighty minutes.)</p>

<p>Mixed results for Rosie: tries from Bismarck du Plessis and Adriaan Strauss - but nil points for South Africa (their two bonus points being 
offset by Coenie Oosthuizen's yellow card). Francois Louw and Michael Leitch do the business for Neph; Pat Lambie and Handre Pollard keep 
things ticking over for Martyn and Jack.</p>

<h3>Game #3</h3>

<p><strong>Group D: <a href="teams.html#Ireland">Ireland</a> 50 - 7 <a href="teams.html#Canada">Canada</a></strong></p>

<p>A solid Irish performance sees Denis retake the lead with a bonus point win (slightly marred by Paul O'Connell's yellow card) and tries 
from Sean O'Brien and Iain Henderson. Jonathan Sexton takes Neph up to second; Ian Madigan moves Chad into positive territory.</p></p>

<h3>Game #2</h3>

<p><strong>Group C: <a href="teams.html#Tonga">Tonga</a> 10 - 17 <a href="teams.html#Georgia">Georgia</a></strong></p>

<p>A typically barnstorming performance from Mamuka Gorgodze sees Jack take the lead - though Denis will be expecting a bucketload of points 
from the next game.</p>

<h2>Friday 18th September</h2>

<h3>Game #1</h3>

<p><strong>Group A: <a href="teams.html#England">England</a> 35 - 11 <a href="teams.html#Fiji">Fiji</a></strong></p>

<p>Denis races out to an early lead thanks to a deserved man-of-the-match performance from Mike Brown in, frankly, a pretty scrappy game. Jack 
gets a bonus point English win and a penalty try to boot. Hugh scores via the slimmed-down Billy Vunipola; Neph via man-mountain Nemani 
Nadolo (or "Nandolo", as Nick Mullins insists on calling him; maybe he's thinking of Nando's?). Martyn and Susie pick up points from the 
boots of Owen Farrell and George Ford respectively. And a yellow card for Nikola Matawalu (who almost redeemed himself with what would have 
been a brilliant try) leave Chad stuck in reverse gear.</p>

<h4>A brief note on replacements</h4>

<p>Once the tournament is underway, if one of your players is withdrawn, I'll try and let you know (or you can let me know). You can then pick 
any unpicked player as a replacement - with the proviso that you will only be credited with points that they score from that point onwards. 
(If there's a sudden spate of withdrawals, replacements will be allocated on a first-come first-served basis.)</p>

<p>Please note that a player who is unavailable for disciplinary reasons (e.g. Mariano Galarza for Argentina) cannot be replaced.</p>

<h4>Payout structure</h4>

<p>The payout structure will be: fifty quid for first place; thirty quid for second place; and twenty quid for third place. (Sorry, 
<strike>Denis</strike> <strike>Chad</strike> <strike>Chris</strike> Martyn, no wooden spoon prize this time.)</p>
